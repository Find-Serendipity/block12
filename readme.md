# Welcome!

I created this website to document my progress as I learn to code with HTML and CSS. 

## Contents

. About - This page is a detailed description about myself, Serendipity!  

. Index/Home - This page is the landing page that serves to direct users across the rest of the site.  

. Listen - A fun feature that lets you listen to the playlist I jammed to while I made the website!  

. Portfolio - This will highlight the kind of work I can do and am capable of producing.
